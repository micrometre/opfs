# OPFS Minimal Example

This is a minimal example of using the Origin Private File System (OPFS) API.

## Getting Started

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
3.  Run the following command to start a simple HTTP server:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

This will serve the `index.html` file and you can interact with the OPFS example.
